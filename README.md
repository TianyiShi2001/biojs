# biojs

## Motivation

I want to rewrite all tools on ExPASy in JS, making it open source and up-to-date. 

To date, many, if not most, bioinformatics tools available on ExPASy and NCBI are not open-sourced, and the underlying source data they use are often based on outdated literature.

For example, the [ExPASy ProtParam tool](https://web.expasy.org/protparam/protpar-ref.html) has not been updated since its publication since [2005](http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/biochemistry+%26+biophysics/book/978-1-58829-343-5).

## Electron App

I want to wrap everything in a desktop application based on the Electron framework.
